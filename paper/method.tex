For our experiments, we use a DenseNet with two densely connected blocks.
Before entering the first block, a convolutional layer with 32 output channels and a $2x2$ average pooling layer are applied.
Following the dense connectivity pattern, the first block consists of 30 convolutional layers with kernel sizes $3x3$ .
For the second block 60 densely connected convolutional layers are used.
The transition layer between both blocks uses a convolutional layer with kernel size $1x1$ and a $2x2$ average pooling layer.
The convolutional layer compresses the number of feature maps by a factor of $0.5$
Analogue to the \textit{TPP-PHOCNet} architecture, our DenseNet makes use of a 5-level TPP layer in combination with a Multilayer Perceptron.
