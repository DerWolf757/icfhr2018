\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented a method for segmentation-free word spotting which combines a novel
ER-framework with a TPP-PHOCNet in an R-CNN framework.
The ER method generates word hypotheses for which PHOCs are predicted.
We proposed three different detectors in order to predict local text scores.
This way, we avoid using a patch-based framework as well generating large amounts of region hypotheses blindly.
In the experimental evaluation we achieve results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art.
